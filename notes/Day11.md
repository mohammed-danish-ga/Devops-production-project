- Learned what Kubernetes is and why it is used over Docker Compose in production.
- Understood core Kubernetes concepts: Cluster, Node, Pod, Deployment, and Service.
- Learned how Kubernetes maintains desired state and provides self-healing.
- Mapped Docker Compose concepts to Kubernetes objects (services → deployments, containers → pods).
- Understood why Kubernetes does not use depends_on and relies on readiness and retries instead.
